## Description

> The motivation for this project was to learn NoSQL, utilizing the MongoDB database.
> MongoDB is a popular use for many social networks because it has flexibility with unstructured data and a large database.
> This project is different from MySQL as the relationships between data sets are more rigid and do not allow for the flexibility of MongoDB.
> I learned how to create a social network app where users can share their thoughts and react to friend's posts.
